## Overview

This assignment involves exploring various networking protocols and concepts using Wireshark and other tools. The tasks were designed to provide hands-on experience with packet analysis, HTTP interactions, DNS resolution, and other essential networking operations.

## Contents

1. **Wireshark Lab: Intro**
    - Identified protocols: UDP, TCP, QUIC
    - Measured response times for HTTP interactions
    - Extracted and analyzed HTTP GET/OK messages

2. **Wireshark Lab: HTTP**
    - Analyzed HTTP GET/response interaction
    - Checked browser and server HTTP versions
    - Monitored data transfer sizes and protocols

3. **Wireshark Lab: DNS**
    - Used `nslookup` for DNS resolution
    - Traced DNS query and response messages
    - Identified DNS response details and ports

## Tools Used

- **Wireshark:** For packet analysis and monitoring
